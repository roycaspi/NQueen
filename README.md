🏰 N-Queen Problem Solver
🧩 About
This repository contains an implementation of the N-Queen problem, a classic combinatorial problem in which N queens must be placed on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

The solution uses backtracking to efficiently find valid queen placements.

🚀 Features
Backtracking Algorithm to explore valid queen placements.
Optimized Recursive Approach for performance.
Customizable Board Size (N can be any positive integer).
Visual Representation of solutions (if applicable).
Efficient Constraint Checking to avoid unnecessary computations.
🛠 Installation
Clone this repository using:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/roycaspi/NQueen.git
cd NQueen
Ensure you have Python 3+ installed.

🎯 Usage
Run the script with:

bash
Copy
Edit
python n_queen.py
You may be able to set the board size (N) via command-line arguments:

bash
Copy
Edit
python n_queen.py 8
This example runs the 8-Queen problem.
